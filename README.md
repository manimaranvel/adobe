Adobe JS image processing 

How to use this file?

To install a JavaScript in the Scripts menu, place it in the Scripts folder (Photoshop CS6 /Presets /Scripts).
The names of the scripts in the Scripts folder, without the file name extension, are displayed in the Scripts
menu. 

Script added to the Scripts folder while Photoshop is running do not appear in the Scripts menu until the
next time you launch the application.

All scripts found in the Scripts folder and sub-folders are displayed at the top level of the File > Scripts
menu. The addition of sub-folders does not add a hierarchical organization to the Scripts menu.

Executing the scripts manually every time
...........................

The Browse item at the end of the Scripts menu (File > Scripts > Browse) allows you to execute scripts
that are not installed in the Scripts folder. You can also use Browse to select scripts installed in the Scripts
folder after the application was last launched.

Selecting Browse displays a file browser dialog which allows you to select a script file for execution. When you select a script file, it is executed the same way as an installed script.

While executing the script it will ask you the folder, where you kept images to process.

next you select a folder to store the processed files.

it will take care of the image and it shows a dialog box when it completes the folder.

Thats it all done,

Note: Follow the same filename format for the files (Check sample folder)
